# App Overview

A basic console app built on .NETCore 5.0.
Project done for an interview with Spreetail.

# Install
You will need to clone two repos to fully utilize and test the program.
The first is this one, and the second is at https://github.com/ajwaters061491/MultiValueDictionaryTests
Make sure both folders are placed in the same location.
The code from this repo will work as a stand alone, but you will not be able to see unit tests without the other repo.
